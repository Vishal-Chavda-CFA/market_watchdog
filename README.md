# üõ°Ô∏è Market Watchdog

**Market Watchdog** is an automated monitoring system that runs silently in the background, watching your investment portfolio for volatility breaches, fetching real-time news, and delivering concise, curated alerts directly to your phone.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Market Watchdog is designed to:

1. **Autostart on Machine Boot**  
   - Logs into Interactive Brokers' TWS automatically.  
   - No manual login required.

2. **Extract Holdings from IBKR**  
   - Pulls live holdings using IB API.  
   - Parses into a Python dataframe.

3. **Resolve Proxies for Each Holding**  
   - Matches each holding to a high-fidelity performance proxy.  
   - Uses OpenAI API to intelligently resolve edge cases.

4. **Benchmarking**  
   - Yesterday‚Äôs closing price serves as the baseline.  
   - Historical data fetched via `yfinance` or IBKR API.

5. **Volatility Tuning**  
   - Pulls 10-year historical data to compute average daily move.  
   - Adjusts for recent volatility trends.

6. **Real-Time Intraday Monitoring**  
   - Checks every 15 seconds during market hours.  
   - Monitors for breaches of adjusted thresholds.

7. **News Triage via Perplexity**  
   - Breaches trigger queries to Perplexity.  
   - News is scraped, summarized, and filtered (Bloomberg prioritized).

8. **SMS Alerts**  
   - Condensed alerts delivered via AT&T‚Äôs email-to-text gateway.  
   - Includes proxy name, % move, summary, and Bloomberg link (if available).

9. **Repeat Notifications**  
   - Sends updates every 2 hours post-breach until market close.  
   - One alert per proxy per breach window.

10. **Fault Tolerance**  
    - Detects TWS disconnects or failures.  
    - Auto-reinitiates and confirms via SMS.
